<p>This is my third discovery of KPOP Group and will be my number. They are  not just people who sing and dance but hey will also touch your heart in every way. They never fail me to show their efforts and love to their fans that makes them unique among the rest. They are special to me. They are the only group that produce and choreo their song and dance , known as "Sel Producing Idol". </p>
